# CIS-343

Some of the git commands that will be useful during this class are, commit, push, branch, merge, and pull. Commit is used to 
save/commit changes to the user's local repository, while push is used to send those changes to the online repository. Branch
can be used to try new code without effecting the working master branch. If the branch is successful it can later be merged with
the master branch. Pull is useful because it allows the user to update their local repository with the most recent version on 
github.
